Predicting Customer Churn Model
In the telecommunications industry, customer churn presents a significant challenge. The objective is to develop
a model that predicts whether a customer will soon terminate their services. This binary classification task aims
to uncover patterns in customer behavior and demographic data that may indicate a propensity to churn. The
ultimate goal is to aid in reducing the financial impact of customer churn by implementing proactive retention
strategies.
Problem Statement
The challenge of retaining customers in a competitive telecommunications landscape is significant. Customer
churn not only leads to revenue loss but also affects reputation and market position. The task is to develop a
predictive model that accurately identifies customers likely to churn, enabling proactive intervention with
targeted retention initiatives.The project therefore targets telecommunications companies, particularly those
interested in understanding and predicting customer churn. Specifically, it aims to provide insights into the
factors influencing customer attrition within the telecom industry. The dataset enables telecom companies to
identify potential churn risks and implement targeted strategies to retain customers and improve overall
satisfaction.
