## Business Understanding
Predicting Customer Churn Model
In the telecommunications industry, customer churn presents a significant challenge. The objective is to develop
a model that predicts whether a customer will soon terminate their services. This binary classification task aims
to uncover patterns in customer behavior and demographic data that may indicate a propensity to churn. The
ultimate goal is to aid in reducing the financial impact of customer churn by implementing proactive retention
strategies.

## Problem Statement
The challenge of retaining customers in a competitive telecommunications landscape is significant. Customer
churn not only leads to revenue loss but also affects reputation and market position. The task is to develop a
predictive model that accurately identifies customers likely to churn, enabling proactive intervention with
targeted retention initiatives.The project therefore targets telecommunications companies, particularly those
interested in understanding and predicting customer churn. Specifically, it aims to provide insights into the
factors influencing customer attrition within the telecom industry. The dataset enables telecom companies to
identify potential churn risks and implement targeted strategies to retain customers and improve overall
satisfaction.

## Objectives
i) Develop and Optimize Classification Models:
ii) Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
iii) Generate Insights and Recommendations:

## Data Understanding
The dataset contains information about customers, their usage patterns, and whether they have churned or not.
(Churn, or customer churn, is an important metric for companies to track when trying to expand their business.
This metric represents the number of customers that have stopped using your product or service during a given
period of time.). In addition, churn, in the context of telecommunications, is the process by which customers
leave a business and stop using the services it provides either because they are unhappy with those services or
because they can find better options from other network providers at more reasonable prices. This could result
in a loss of revenue or profit for the business.
The dataset consists of 21 columns and 3333 rows representing various attributes of customers in the
telecommunications industry

## Major Findings
i) WV has the highest number of customers while CA has the lowest number
ii) 415 area code has the highest number of customers whereas areas codes 408 and 510 have similar number of customers. This distribution of customers across area codes suggests potential differences in markets or marketing priorities.
iii) A majority of the customers do not have an international plan.
iv) The bar plot visualizes the distribution of customers based on whether they have a voice mail plan or not. It shows that majority of the customers do not have a Voice mail plan.
v) Since most of the customers do not have a voicemail plan, it explains why the number of voice messages are 0.
vi) The majority of customers incur night charges ranging between 7.7 and 7.9.
Major comparisons between day,night and evening show: i) Usage Intensity: The analysis suggests that usage intensity varies across different time periods. While the highest number of total day calls is common among the majority of customers, the number of evening and night calls shows a more consistent pattern.
vii) Charge Patterns: Although the highest total day charge is relatively high, the highest total evening and night charges are comparatively lower, indicating potential differences in pricing or usage patterns across these time periods.
viii) Customer service is the predominant pattern among churned customers from the telecom service: a significant portion of them initiated at least one customer service call. This suggests that these customers likely sought assistance to resolve issues they faced with various aspects of the service, billing, or other elements of their experience. Consequently, it underscores the need for a thorough analysis of the feedback provided during these interactions. Such analysis could unveil valuable insights into the reasons underlying their decision to churn.

### Model Evaluation
# Logistic Regression:
Accuracy: 85.01%
Precision: 51.52%
Recall: 16.83%
F1-score: 25.37%
AUC-ROC Score: 57.00%
Summary: Logistic Regression has high accuracy but low precision and recall, indicating poor
performance in identifying churned customers. The AUC-ROC score is low, reflecting limited overall
performance.
## Decision Tree:
Accuracy: 92.20%
Precision: 74.75%
Recall: 73.27%
F1-score: 74.00%
AUC-ROC Score: 84.43%
Summary: Decision Tree demonstrates high accuracy and balanced precision and recall, indicating good
performance in identifying churned customers. The AUC-ROC score suggests strong overall
performance.
## Random Forest:
Accuracy: 92.65%
Precision: 98.15%
Recall: 52.48%
F1-score: 68.39%
AUC-ROC Score: 76.15%
Summary: Random Forest shows high accuracy and precision but lower recall, meaning it misses some
churned customers. The AUC-ROC score indicates moderate overall performance.
## XGBoost:
Accuracy: 95.80%
Precision: 95.06%
Recall: 76.24%
F1-score: 84.62%
AUC-ROC Score: 87.77%
Summary: XGBoost has the highest accuracy, precision, and F1-score among the models, with a good
balance of recall. The high AUC-ROC score indicates excellent overall performance.
The XGBoost Model appears to be the best model for this classification task.
It has the highest accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score among all the models evaluated.
XGBoost is the most suitable model for predicting customer churn.
